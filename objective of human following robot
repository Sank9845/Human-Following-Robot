The objective of the Human Following Robot project is to design and develop a robot that can track and follow a human target, typically its owner or operator, as they move around in various environments. This project aims to create a robot that can autonomously navigate and maintain a safe distance from the human, using sensors and artificial intelligence to detect and respond to the person's movements. The goal is to enable the robot to assist, accompany, or provide services to the human, such as carrying loads, providing surveillance, or offering companionship, while adapting to changing circumstances and ensuring safety. By achieving this objective, the project seeks to advance robotics technology and explore innovative applications in areas like healthcare, transportation, and customer service.
